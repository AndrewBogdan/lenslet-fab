# Code for controlling Shawn's stuff

I'll write something here once I have a reason to.
-Andrew


## To-Do List

1. Real xy=0 (configurable)
   - This also requires bound-defining
   - These would also be good to put in a config, you'd need to do it all
        at once, and then it would move its full range and ask you if it's
        still in the same spot.
2. Lase hexagonally a large circle
3. Cut code
4. Gas
5. Make a break=True/False option to have movement commands wait until they're
   completed to exit.
